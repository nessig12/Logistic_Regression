# Logistic_Regression

Programming Assignment 1
In this assignment, you need to build a neural network by yourself and implement the backpropagation algorithm to train it.

Each team must write a webpage report on the assignment. For example, http://www.cs.bu.edu/faculty/betke/cs440/restricted/p1/p1-template.html. To ensure that each team member builds his or her own electronic portfolio, we ask that everybody submits his or her own report.

Learning Objectives
1.Understand how neural networks work
2.Implement a simple neural network
3.Apply backpropagation algorithm to train a neural network
4.Understand the role of different parameters of a neural network, such as epoch and learning rate.
